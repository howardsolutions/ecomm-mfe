# Micro Frontend Architecture Notes and Projects

## Read My Public Note on MicroFE in order here.

### 1. [Micro Frontend 101](https://howardphung.hashnode.dev/micro-frontends-101)

### 2. [Understanding Module Federation](https://howardphung.hashnode.dev/understanding-the-basics-of-module-federation)

### 3. [Share Dependencies between MicroFE Apps](https://howardphung.hashnode.dev/share-dependencies-between-micro-fe-apps)

## Application Requirements (for MFP)

<details>

<summary> Open to Read ðŸ“‚ </summary>

### Inflexible Requirement #1: ZERO Coupling between Child Projects

ðŸ‘‰ NO import of functions / objects / classes / etc

ðŸ‘‰ NO Shared State

ðŸ‘‰ Shared libraries through MF is OK

### Inflexible Requirement #2: NEAR ZERO coupling between CONTAINER and CHILD APPS

ðŸ‘‰ CONTAINER shouldn't assume that a CHILD is Using a PARTICULAR framework

ðŸ‘‰ Any neccessary Communication done with callbacks or Simple Events

### Inflexible Requirement #3: CSS from one project shouldn't affect another.

### Inflexible Requirement #4: VERSION CONTROL (monorepo vs Separate REPOS) shoudn't have any impact on the overall project

### Inflexible Requirement #5: Container should be ABLE to decide to ALWAYS use the LATEST version of a micro Frontend or speficy a Specific version

1. Container will ALWAYS use the LATEST version of a CHILD app (does not require a Re-deploy of Container)

2. Container can SPECIFY EXACTLY WHAT VERSION of a child it wants to use (requires a re-deploy to change)

</details>

## REQUIREMENTs Arroud Deployment

ðŸ‘‰ We want DEPLOY each microFE app independently (including the CONTAINER - HOST)

ðŸ‘‰ Location of child app remoteEntry.js files must be known at BUILD TIME

ðŸ‘‰ MANY FE deployment solutions assume you're deploying a single project - we need something that can handle MULTIPLE different ones.

ðŸ‘‰ Probably need a CI CD pipeline of some sort

ðŸ‘‰ At present, the remoteEntry.js file name is fixed! Need to think about Caching issues.

## PATH to Production

Git Monorepo, includes: Container, marketing, dashboard, auth.

Each time make a change to one of these projects

=> TRIGGER Build a production version of corresponding apps

=> UPLOAD the files to Amazon S3

## Workflow for deploying CONTAINER

- Whenever code is pushed to the master branch, and this commit contains a change to the `Container` folder

-- COMMANDS executed in a virtual machine HOSTED by GITHUB

=> Change into the container folder

=> Install dependencies

=> Create a production build using WEBPACK

=> Upload the result to AWS S3

## A production-style Workflow

ðŸ‘‰ Each team develops features on git branches named something like `container-dev`

ðŸ‘‰ Feature complete and ready for deployment? PUSH branch to github

ðŸ‘‰ Create pull request to merge into master/main

ðŸ‘‰ Other engineers REVIEW

ðŸ‘‰ When ready to deploy, MERGE the PR

ðŸ‘‰ Workflow detects a change => the `master / main` branch, deployment runs!

## Issues with CSS in Microfrontends

ðŸ‘‰ In micro frontend we have multiple different apps, from different teams, each team can have slightly different way of styling, which leads to conflicting CSS when they assembled inside the container.

### SOLUTION

1. CSS SCOPING

- Custom CSS you are writing for your project
  - use CSS in JS lib
  - Use React built in component style scoping
  - Use Angular's built-in component style scoping....
  - "Namespace" all your CSS

2. CSS coming from a component library or CSS library (bootstrap)

   - Use a component library that does css-in-js
   - Manually build the css lib and apply namespacing techniques to it

## Inflexible Requirements Arround Navigation

### 1) BOTH Containner + Individual Sub-APPS need routing features

ðŸ‘‰ Users can navigate around to different subapps using routing logic built into the Container

ðŸ‘‰ Users can navigate around in a sub-app using routing logic built into the `subapp ITSELF`

ðŸ‘‰ NOT ALL subapps will require routing.

### 2) Sub-apps might need to add in new pages/routes all the time

ðŸ‘‰ New routes added to the sub-app shouldn't require a re-deploy of the Container

### 3) We might need to show 2 or more microFEs at the same time

ðŸ‘‰ This will occur all the time if we have some kind of Sidebar nav that is built as a seperate microfrontend

### 4) We want to use "off the shelf" Routing Solution

ðŸ‘‰ Building a routing library can be hard - we don't want to author a new one!

ðŸ‘‰ Some amout of custom coding is OK

### 5) We need navigation features for sub-apps in both hosted mode and in isolation.

ðŸ‘‰ Developing for each environment should be easy - a developer should immediately be able to see what path they are visiting

### 6) In different apps need to communicate information about routing, it should be done in as generic a fashion as possible

ðŸ‘‰ Each app might be using a completely different navigation framework

ðŸ‘‰ We might swap out or upgrade navigation libraries all the time -- shouldn't require a rewrite of the rest of the app.

## Routing libraries decide what content to show on the screen.

ðŸ‘‰ HISTORY => Object to GET and SET current PATH the user is visting

ðŸ‘‰ ROUTER => Shows different content BASED upon the current PATH

### BROWSER HISTORY OBJECT

-> Look at the `path` portion of the `url` (everything after the domain) to figure out WHAT the CURRENT PATH is.

`http ://app.com  /maketing/price`

### MEMORY HISTORY (Abstract History - in VUEJS)

-> KEEP track of the CURRENT PATH in MEMORY, don't show the current path changes dirrectly in address bar. But can view with a console.log

`http ://app.com  /maketing/price`

### HASH HISTORY

-> Look at everything after the `#` in the URL to figure out the current path.

`http ://app.com  #marketing/price`

## Back to the application

- We gonna make use of BROWSER HISTORY in CONTAINER App

AND MEMORY HISTORY in Sub-app (REMOTE)

- The BROWSER HISTORY inside of the CONTAINER is the ONLY copy of HISTORY that will access the Address bar and take a look at the URL inside there, eventually update it as well.

- The MEMORY HISTORY object inside all of our different childeren are going to have their own SEPARATE COPY of what the current URL is.

They can change that, update that as they please.

- We will eventually add in some code to make sure we sync the PATH across multiple different copy of HISTORY 

- WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT IS that as these different copies of history decide to start to NAVIGATE AROUND, they are not going to the address bar to change it in someway. which can lead to some potential big problem down the road.

## COMMUNICATION BETWEEN APPS

Communication about Routing between Container and SubApp! <br />
It should be done in as GENERIC a way as possible!

1) User clicks link governed by Container (Browser History)

=> Communicate the change DOWN to MARKETING

=> Marketing's Memory History should UPDATE its current path.

2) User clicks link governed by Marketing (Memory History)

=> Communicate the change UP to CONTAINER

=> CONTAINER'S BROWSER HISTORY should UPDATE its current path

## NOTES AROUND AUTHENTICATION

ðŸ‘‰ Auth app is for signing in/up users

ðŸ‘‰ Auth app is not for enforcing permissions, allowing access to certain routes. Or figuring out if user is signed in.

ðŸ‘‰ TWO APPROACHES FOR HANDLING AUTH

ðŸ‘‰ 1. Each app is aware of auth

ðŸ‘‰ 2. Centralize Auth in `container`
